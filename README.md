# Poor3D Engine
Poor3D is a open source 3D game engine. The goal is to implement modern rendering technique and make it easy to be used.

This is the third engine made on my own. I refer to some of the existing engine on the Internet like Orge3D, Irrlicht, Torque3D and theBennyBox.

If there are some bugs or unnecessary code feel free to report.
